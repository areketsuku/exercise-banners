# Exercise

This is a rework of an exercice from ISDI Coders fullstack bootcamp. I've choosed to start from the beginning instead of refactor the original work I made in order to achieve the same result from a simpler perspective.

## Objective

Using only HTML & CSS, create 5 vertical banners (or more) wich should ocupy as much space as there is. On hover, a banner should grow x5 of its original width, and text should appear from bottom.
